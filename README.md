<h1>Virtual AI Painter</h1>
developed using computer vision in python.

Thank you Krish Naik(YT), Murtaza's Workshop(YT), and a few other creator to help me fix the errors in my code and make my code better.

<h2>About the Project</h2>
This AI Virtual Painter recognises your hand, considers your forefinger node to draw anything you want with four different colors. I simple words, you just need to draw anything in the air, the design gets displayed on the screen. This algorithm can be used in various industries like education, film industry, security and criminology, digital art, etc.


<h1>Thank You!</h1>
